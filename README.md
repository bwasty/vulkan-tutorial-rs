# vulkan-tutorial-rs
Rust version of https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial.

*Goal*: Rust port with code structure as similar as possible to the original C++, so the tutorial can easily be followed (similar to [learn-opengl-rs](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs).

**Current State**: Very early, got up to [Swap chain](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Presentation/Swap_chain) so far, but the code isn't yet split up by chapter.
