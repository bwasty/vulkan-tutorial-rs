# vulkan-tutorial-rs
Rust version of https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial.

**Goal**: Rust port with code structure as similar as possible to the original C++, so the original tutorial can easily be followed (similar to [learn-opengl-rs](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs)).

**Current State**: Very early, got up to the end of [Graphics pipeline basics](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics) so far, but the code isn't yet split up by chapter.
